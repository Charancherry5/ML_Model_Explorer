# ML_Model_Explorer
ML Model Explorer is an interactive web application built using Streamlit, designed to simplify the process of exploring and experimenting with machine learning models. The application allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, select features, choose machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

# Features
- ##### Upload and Inspect Data: Upload CSV files and view the dataset along with a summary of statistics, data types, and null values.
- ##### Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
- ##### Data Visualization: Generate heatmaps and pairplots to understand the relationships between features.
- ##### Feature Selection: Choose target and feature variables for model training.
- ##### Model Training and Evaluation:
    - Support for regression and classification tasks.
    - Models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
    - Evaluate models using metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
    - Decision Boundaries: Visualize decision boundaries for classifiers with two features.
